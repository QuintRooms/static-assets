<h2>Reservation Types</h2>

<p>
    Prepaid Reservation – Paid online at the time of booking
</p>
<p>
    You agree that your credit card will be charged for the full cost of your reservation upon submitting your reservation request. The cost of your reservation is the total of the
    room(s), plus an additional amount for the tax recovery charges and service fees (if applicable). The tax recovery charge is assessed to recover the amount we pay to the
    property in connection with your reservation for sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, and other similar taxes, etc., and the balance of the
    additional amount is a fee we charge in connection with the handling of your reservation. We are not the vendor collecting and remitting said tax to the applicable tax
    authorities. The vendors bill all applicable taxes to us and we remit such tax directly to the vendor. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or
    reserve our customer’s travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. Our actual tax cost paid to the vendor may vary from the tax
    recovery charge, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the property, automobile, etc. by our customer. There may be restrictions
    on cancellations of a Prepaid Reservation, including non-refundability, cancellation fees, change fees, or the hotel may not provide for. You agree to pay any cancellation fees
    that you incur.
</p>
<p>
    Pay on Arrival – Payment is secured by the property upon your arrival
</p>
<p>
    The toal room charges plus tax and incidentals are secured by the property upon your arrival, and charged by the property upon your departure. Some properties may charge a
    deposit in advance of your arrival. A Pay on Arrival reservation may require a service fee to obtain the advertised rates. The service fee is non-refundable and will be charged when you place your reservation. The service fee will appear on your credit card statements under
    Hotel Accommodations.
</p>
<h2>Relationship</h2>

<p>
    The relationship between the travel vendors supplying services (“Suppliers”), QUINT, and you will be that of a rooms provider, broker, and customer respectively, and none of the
    parties listed or any of our respective officers, agents, or employees will be held or construed to be partners, joint ventures, fiduciaries, employees, or agents of the other.
</p>
<h2>Refusal of Service</h2>

<p>
    QUINT reserves the right to refuse service to anyone at our sole discretion so long as our refusal to provide service does not violate any applicable federal or state law.
</p>
<h2>Termination of Site</h2>

<p>
    QUINT reserves the right to terminate the site and cancel the service provided by the site at any time for any reason or no reason at all.
</p>
<h2>Customer Changes and Cancellations</h2>

<p>
    You may cancel or change your Prepaid Reservation unless otherwise stated in the specific terms associated with the inventory you agree to purchase. Some cancellations or
    room-night reductions may result in a per room per night service fee. In addition, if you cancel or change your reservation after the cancellation policy period applicable to
    the hotel and room type you reserved, you may be subject to a charge of one-night’s room rate, tax recovery charges, and service fees, or greater penalties based on the terms
    of your reservation. Refunds may or may not be made for no-shows or early checkouts. See the room rate cancellation policies and other terms and conditions for complete
    details. You agree to pay any cancellation or change fee that you incur. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions and cancellation policies imposed with respect ot any
    completed reservation. Please review the terms and conditions associated with your reservation!
</p>
<h2>Bank and Credit Card Fees</h2>

<p>
    Some banks and credit cards impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside the United States, the bank or credit card may convert your
    home currency into a local currency and charge you a conversion fee. If this is the case, the amount shown on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency
    and therefore a different amount shown on the website. The exchange rate and conversion fee are solely determined by your bank on the day that the transaction is processed. QUINT
    has no ability to dictate these fees.
</p>
