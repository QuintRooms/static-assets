<h4>
    Reservation Types
</h4>
<h4>
    Prepaid Reservation - Paid online at the time of booking
</h4>
<p>
    You agree that your credit card will be charged for the full cost of your reservation upon submitting your reservation request. The cost of your reservation is the total of the room(s), plus an additional amount for the tax recovery charges and service fees (if applicable). The tax recovery charge is assessed to recover the amount we pay to the property in connection with your reservation for sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added and other similar taxes etc., and the balance of the additional amount is a fee we charge in connection with the handling of your reservation. We are not the vendor collecting and remitting said tax to the applicable tax authorities. The vendors bill all applicable taxes to us and we remit such tax directly to the vendor. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. Our actual tax cost paid to the vendor may vary from the tax recovery charge, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the property, automobile, etc. by our customer. There may be restrictions on cancellations of a Prepaid Reservation, including non-refundability, cancellation fees, change fees, or the hotel may not provide for . You agree to pay any cancellation fees that you incur.
</p>
<h4>
    Pay on Arrival - Payment is secured by the property upon your arrival
</h4>
<p>
    The total room charges plus tax and incidentals are secured by the property upon your arrival, and charged by the property upon your departure. Some properties may charge a deposit in advance of your arrival. A Pay on Arrival reservation may require a service fee to obtain the advertised rates. This service fee may range from $0.00 to $10.00 (USD) per room/per night. The service fee is non-refundable and will be charged when you place your reservation. The service fee will appear on your credit card statement under Hotel Accommodations.
</p>
<h4>
    Social Component of Reservation
</h4>
<p>
    Because Quint & H4H integrates a socially responsible component into each reservation booked through this website, you are agreeing that $1 from the hotel and $1 from Quint & H4H may be contributed to a 501(c)(3) charity. Upon checkout, you might see language regarding these fees
</p>
<h4>
    Relationship
</h4>
<p>
    The relationship between the travel vendors supplying services (Suppliers), Quint & H4H, and you will be that of a rooms provider, broker, and customer respectively, and none of the parties listed or any of our respective officers, agents or employees will be held or construed to be partners, joint ventures, fiduciaries, employees or agents of the other.
</p>

<h4>
    Bank and Credit Card Fees
</h4>
<p>
    Some banks and credit card impose fees for international transactions. If you are making a booking from outside the United States, the bank or credit card may convert your home currency into local currency and charge you a conversion fee. If this is the case, the amount shown on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and so therefore a different amount shown on the website. The exchange rate and conversion fee are solely determined by your bank on the day that the transaction is processed. Quint & H4H has no ability to dictate these fees.
